# NFC Attendance & Payment System (ESP32 + PN532)

## Project Overview
This project is an attendance and payment system using an ESP32 microcontroller, a PN532 NFC reader, and NFC tags/cards. It is designed for applications such as classrooms, offices, or events where tracking attendance and handling simple payments is required.

## Roadmap

### 1. Project Planning
- Define requirements: attendance, payment, user management, security.
- Decide on user interface: Serial, Web, Mobile App, LCD, etc.
- Choose data storage: Local (EEPROM/SD), Remote (Cloud/Server).

### 2. Hardware Setup
- ESP32 microcontroller
- PN532 NFC module
- NFC tags/cards
- Optional: LCD display, buzzer, relay, keypad, etc.
- Power supply

### 3. Wiring and Initial Testing
- Connect PN532 to ESP32 (I2C/SPI/UART, usually I2C is easiest).
- Test NFC reading using example sketches from the Adafruit PN532 library.

### 4. Software Development
- **PlatformIO/Arduino setup**: Install PlatformIO or Arduino IDE. Add ESP32 board support. Create a new project and configure `platformio.ini` for ESP32 and required libraries.
- **Install Adafruit PN532 library**: Add the Adafruit PN532 library to your project. In PlatformIO, add `adafruit/Adafruit PN532` to `platformio.ini` under `lib_deps`.
- **Basic NFC functionality**:
  - Connect PN532 to ESP32 (I2C recommended: SDA to GPIO21, SCL to GPIO22).
  - Use example code from the Adafruit PN532 library to detect and read NFC tag UIDs.
  - Print detected UIDs to the Serial Monitor for verification.
- **Attendance system**:
  - Create a user registration process: associate each NFC tag UID with a user (name, ID, etc.).
  - When a tag is scanned, log the attendance with timestamp and user info.
  - Store logs locally (EEPROM/SD card) or send to a remote server via WiFi.
- **Payment system**:
  - Assign a balance to each registered user/tag.
  - Deduct balance when a tag is scanned for payment.
  - Handle insufficient funds, top-up, and transaction logging.
- **Data storage**:
  - Use EEPROM or SD card for local storage of user data and logs.
  - Optionally, connect to a remote server/database (HTTP/MQTT) for centralized data management.
- **User interface**:
  - Use Serial Monitor for debugging and basic interaction.
  - Optionally, add an LCD/OLED display for user feedback (e.g., attendance marked, payment successful, balance info).
  - Optionally, implement a web server on ESP32 for admin/user management and viewing logs.
- **Security**:
  - Prevent tag spoofing by using unique UIDs and, if possible, cryptographic tags.
  - Secure WiFi communication using HTTPS or MQTT with TLS if connecting to a server.

#### Example: Basic NFC Tag Reading (Pseudo-code)
```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_PN532.h>

#define SDA_PIN 21
#define SCL_PIN 22
Adafruit_PN532 nfc(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  nfc.begin();
  uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion();
  if (!versiondata) {
    Serial.println("Didn't find PN53x board");
    while (1);
  }
  nfc.SAMConfig();
  Serial.println("Waiting for an NFC card...");
}

void loop() {
  uint8_t uid[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
  uint8_t uidLength;
  if (nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A, uid, &uidLength)) {
    Serial.print("UID: ");
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < uidLength; i++) {
      Serial.print(uid[i], HEX);
    }
    Serial.println();
    delay(1000);
  }
}
```

You can now proceed to implement user registration, attendance logging, and payment logic based on this foundation.
