# Project Development Order

Here’s the best order to proceed for your NFC attendance/payment system project:

---

## 1. Card Registration & UID Collection
- Scan each NFC card/tag and collect its UID.
- Store each UID with user info (name, ID, etc.)—for now, you can print and manually record them.

## 2. Design Data Structure
- Decide what information you need for each user (UID, name, balance, attendance, etc.).
- Choose where to store this data:
  - **Local:** EEPROM, SD card, or SPIFFS on ESP32.
  - **Remote:** Cloud database (Firebase, MySQL, etc.).

## 3. Build the Database
- Set up your chosen database and create tables/collections for users, attendance, and payments.

## 4. Develop the Backend
- Create a backend (server or cloud function) to:
  - Receive data from ESP32 (via HTTP, MQTT, etc.).
  - Process attendance/payment logic.
  - Interact with the database.
  - Optionally, provide APIs for admin/web/mobile apps.

## 5. Integrate ESP32 with Backend
- Update your ESP32 code to send scanned UIDs and actions (attendance/payment) to the backend.
- Handle backend responses (e.g., access granted, payment successful).

## 6. Build User/Admin Interface (Optional)
- Create a web or mobile app for admins to view logs, manage users, and top up balances.

## 7. Testing & Security
- Test the full workflow (scan, log, payment).
- Add security (e.g., authentication, encrypted communication).

**Summary:**
1. Register cards & collect UIDs  
2. Design your data structure  
3. Build the database  
4. Develop the backend  
5. Integrate ESP32 with backend  
6. Build user/admin interface (optional)  
7. Test and secure the system
